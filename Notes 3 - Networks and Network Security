# Course 3: Networks and Network Security
## Module 1: Network architecture

### Introduction to Networks

#### Network Basics
- **Network**: A group of connected devices that can communicate with each other
- **Network Architecture**: The basic structure and design of a network
- **Network Security**: Protection of network infrastructure and data from threats and vulnerabilities
- **Device Identification**: Devices locate each other using unique identifiers (IP and MAC addresses)

#### Network Types
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Spans a small area (office building, school, home)
  - Example: Your home devices connected to WiFi
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Spans a large geographical area (city, state, country)
  - The internet is essentially one large WAN
  - Enables resource sharing across geographic locations

#### Network Devices
1. **Hub**
   - Broadcasts information to every device on the network
   - Similar to a radio tower broadcasting to all tuned radios
   - Less secure and less efficient

2. **Switch**
   - More intelligent than a hub
   - Makes connections between specific devices
   - Only passes data to the intended destination
   - Improves network performance and security
   - Maintains a MAC address table to direct packets
   - Operates at the data link layer in the TCP/IP model

3. **Router**
   - Connects multiple networks together
   - Directs traffic based on IP addresses
   - Reads destination addresses and forwards data accordingly
   - Part of the network layer in the TCP/IP model
   - Can include firewall features to filter traffic

4. **Modem**
   - Connects router to the internet
   - Provides internet access to the LAN
   - Receives digital signals and translates them to analog signals
   - Usually connects to a router that distributes connections to local devices

5. **Firewall**
   - Monitors traffic to/from the network
   - First line of defense
   - Restricts specific incoming/outgoing traffic
   - Typically positioned between internal network and external resources

6. **Wireless Access Point**
   - Creates wireless networks using Wi-Fi
   - Sends/receives digital signals over radio waves
   - Devices connect using wireless adapters

#### Client-Server Model
- **Servers**: Provide information and services
- **Clients**: Devices that connect to servers and request information/services
- Common server types:
  - DNS servers (domain name lookups)
  - File servers (store/retrieve files)
  - Mail servers (organize company email)

#### Cloud Computing
- Uses remote servers hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices
- **Cloud Network**: Collection of servers that store resources and data in remote data centers
- Accessed via the internet from any location
- Growing trend as businesses migrate to reduce costs and simplify operations

#### Cloud Service Models
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Remote software suites
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual computer components (containers, storage)
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Tools for designing custom applications

#### Advanced Network Concepts
- **Software-Defined Networks (SDN)**: Virtual network devices and services
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Organizations using both CSP services and on-premise resources
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using more than one Cloud Service Provider

#### Benefits of Cloud Computing
1. **Reliability**: Consistent access to resources with minimal interruption
2. **Cost Reduction**: Lower upfront costs, pay-as-you-go model
3. **Scalability**: Easy to scale resources up or down as needed

#### Network Diagrams
- Visual maps showing devices on a network and their connections
- Used by security analysts to understand network architecture
- Help develop strategies for securing networks

#### Career Insights
- Network security professionals protect network systems and user data
- Skills needed:
  - Command line usage
  - Log parsing
  - Network traffic analysis
  - Communication skills
  - Continuous learning and curiosity

### Network Communication

#### Data Transmission Fundamentals
- **Data Packets**: Basic units of information transmitted between devices
  - Contains: destination address, source address, protocol number, message body, and footer
  - Similar to a physical letter with addressing and content

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Bandwidth**: Amount of data received per second (quantity of data รท time)
  - **Speed**: Rate at which data packets are received/downloaded
  - Irregular bandwidth/speed can indicate a network attack
  - **Packet sniffing**: Capturing and inspecting data packets across a network

#### TCP/IP Model
The standard model for network communication consisting of four layers:

##### 1. Network Access Layer (lowest)
- Deals with creation and transmission of data packets
- Includes physical hardware (hubs, modems, cables, wiring)
- Contains the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
  - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for local network communication

##### 2. Internet Layer
- Ensures delivery to destination hosts (potentially on different networks)
- Attaches IP addresses to data packets
- Key protocols:
  - **Internet Protocol (IP)**: Routes packets to correct destination
  - **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**: Shares error information and status updates

##### 3. Transport Layer
- Controls traffic flow across networks
- Responsible for delivering data between systems
- Key protocols:
  - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**:
    - Establishes connections between devices
    - Ensures reliable data transmission
    - Contains port numbers for destination services
  - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**:
    - Connectionless protocol (doesn't establish connections before transmission)
    - Used for performance-sensitive applications (video streaming)
    - Less tracking/reliability than TCP

##### 4. Application Layer (highest)
- Handles interaction with receiving devices
- Defines internet services and applications accessible to users
- Common protocols:
  - HTTP/HTTPS (web browsing)
  - SMTP (email)
  - SSH (secure remote access)
  - FTP (file transfers)
  - DNS (domain name resolution)

### Ports
- Software-based locations within operating systems that organize data transmission
- Divide network traffic based on service type
- Common port numbers:
  - Port 25: Email
  - Port 443: Secure internet communication
  - Port 20: Large file transfers

### OSI Model Comparison
The OSI model has 7 layers compared to TCP/IP's 4 layers:

1. **Physical Layer** (cables, hardware)
2. **Data Link Layer** (switches, network interface cards)
3. **Network Layer** (routing between networks)
4. **Transport Layer** (data delivery, TCP/UDP)
5. **Session Layer** (connection establishment, authentication)
6. **Presentation Layer** (data translation, encryption)
7. **Application Layer** (user-facing applications)

TCP/IP combines multiple OSI layers:
- TCP/IP Network Access Layer = OSI Physical + Data Link Layers
- TCP/IP Internet Layer = OSI Network Layer
- TCP/IP Transport Layer = OSI Transport Layer
- TCP/IP Application Layer = OSI Application + Presentation + Session Layers

### Local and Wide Network Communication

#### IP Addressing
- **IP Address**: Unique string identifying device location on the internet
- Two versions:
  
  #### IPv4
  - Format: Four 1-3 digit numbers separated by periods (e.g., 198.51.100.0)
  - 4 bytes total (32 bits)
  - Allows up to 4.3 billion possible addresses
  - Header size: 20-60 bytes
  
  #### IPv6
  - Format: Eight hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2002:0db8::ff21:0023:1234)
  - 16 bytes total (128 bits)
  - Allows 340 undecillion addresses
  - Developed to address IPv4 exhaustion
  - Simpler header format than IPv4
  - Offers more efficient routing and eliminates private address collisions

- **Public vs Private IP Addresses**:
  - **Public**: Assigned by ISP, connected to geographic location, shared by all devices on network
  - **Private**: Only visible to devices on same local network, enables internal communication

#### MAC Addresses
- Unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each physical device
- Used by switches to direct data packets to appropriate devices
- Switches maintain MAC address tables mapping addresses to ports

#### IPv4 Packet Structure
- **Header** (20-60 bytes):
  - Version (VER): Protocol used (IPv4)
  - Header Length (HLEN/IHL): Where header ends and data begins
  - Type of Service (ToS): For prioritizing packets
  - Total Length: Size of entire packet (max 65,535 bytes)
  - Identification, Flags, Fragmentation Offset: Used for packet fragmentation
  - Time to Live (TTL): Prevents infinite packet forwarding
  - Protocol: Protocol used for data portion
  - Header Checksum: Detects header corruption
  - Source/Destination IP Addresses
  - Options: Security options (if HLEN > 5)

- **Data Section**: Variable size, contains the actual message

#### Security Implications
- IP data packets contain critical security information:
  - Source (where packet is coming from)
  - Destination (where it's going)
  - Protocol being used
- Analyzing packet fields reveals important security details
- IPv6 offers security advantages over IPv4
  - More efficient routing
  - Eliminates private address collisions
