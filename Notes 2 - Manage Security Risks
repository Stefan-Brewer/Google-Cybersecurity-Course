# Cybersecurity: Course 2 Module 1 Study Notes

## CISSP Security Domains Overview

The CISSP framework identifies eight security domains that organize cybersecurity work:

1. **Security and Risk Management**
   - Focuses on: Security goals, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations
   - Core function: Developing security posture - an organization's ability to defend assets and react to change
   - Key components: InfoSec processes, playbooks, and training programs

2. **Asset Security**
   - Focuses on: Managing digital and physical assets throughout their lifecycle
   - Key activities: Storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data
   - Example: Overseeing proper hard drive destruction to prevent data access by threat actors

3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**
   - Focuses on: Optimizing data security through effective tools, systems, and processes
   - Core concept: Shared responsibility - all individuals take active roles in security
   - Key principles: Threat modeling, least privilege, defense in depth, fail securely, etc.

4. **Communication and Network Security**
   - Focuses on: Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications
   - Scope: On-site, remote, and cloud communications
   - Example: Protecting employees working remotely from vulnerabilities on public WiFi

5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - Focuses on: Access and authorization controls to protect data
   - Core concept: Principle of least privilege
   - Components: Identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability

6. **Security Assessment and Testing**
   - Focuses on: Identifying and mitigating risks through control testing and data analysis
   - Key activities: Security control testing, data collection/analysis, and security audits
   - Example: Penetration testing to find vulnerabilities before threat actors do

7. **Security Operations**
   - Focuses on: Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures
   - Key responsibilities: Incident response, digital forensic investigations, and threat neutralization
   - Timeline: Begins once a security incident is identified, requires urgent action

8. **Software Development Security**
   - Focuses on: Secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle
   - Key principle: Security must be integrated into each phase, not added afterward
   - Activities: Secure design reviews, code reviews, and penetration testing

## Security Fundamentals: Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### Core Definitions
- **Asset**: An item perceived as having value to an organization (digital or physical)
- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
- **Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

### Risk Levels
- **Low-risk assets**: Public information that wouldn't harm operations if compromised
- **Medium-risk assets**: Non-public information that could cause some damage if compromised
- **High-risk assets**: Information protected by regulations that would cause severe damage if compromised

### Risk Management Strategies
- **Acceptance**: Accepting a risk to maintain business continuity
- **Avoidance**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk entirely
- **Transference**: Transferring risk management to a third party
- **Mitigation**: Reducing the impact of a known risk

### Common Threats and Vulnerabilities
- **Social engineering**: Manipulation techniques exploiting human error (e.g., phishing)
- **Insider threats**: Staff members or vendors abusing authorized access
- **Advanced persistent threats (APTs)**: Maintaining unauthorized access for extended periods
- **Ransomware**: Malicious attacks encrypting organizational data for ransom payments
- **Technical vulnerabilities**: ProxyLogon, ZeroLogon, Log4Shell, etc.

### The Web Layers
- **Surface web**: Publicly accessible content via standard browsers
- **Deep web**: Content requiring authorization (e.g., company intranets)
- **Dark web**: Content accessible only via specialized software, often used for criminal activities

### Key Impacts of Security Incidents
1. **Financial impact**: Production interruption, correction costs, compliance fines
2. **Identity theft**: Compromise of PII and sensitive data
3. **Reputational damage**: Loss of customer trust and potential legal consequences

## NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

A seven-step approach to manage security and privacy risks:

1. **Prepare**: Establish risk management activities before breaches occur
2. **Categorize**: Develop processes based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs
3. **Select**: Choose and document controls that protect organizational assets
4. **Implement**: Execute security and privacy plans throughout the organization
5. **Assess**: Evaluate if controls are implemented correctly and meeting needs
6. **Authorize**: Take accountability for security and privacy risks
7. **Monitor**: Maintain awareness of system operations and effectiveness

## Career Insights

Key skills for cybersecurity professionals:
- Technical analysis and problem-solving
- Teamwork and communication
- Customer service and interpersonal skills
- Adaptability and continuous learning

Multiple entry paths exist into cybersecurity careers:
- Military training and experience
- Community college and certification programs
- Career transitions from IT or customer service roles
- Self-directed learning and industry conferences

Common entry-level analyst responsibilities:
- Monitoring access requests and permissions
- Addressing system misconfigurations and patching needs
- Working across teams to develop security solutions
- Analyzing security risks and implementing controls
