- Technical: Firewalls, MFA, antivirus software
- Administrative: Separation of duties, authorization, asset classification

**Key Controls:**
- Encryption: Converting data from readable format (plaintext) to encoded format (ciphertext)
- Authentication: Verifying who someone is (e.g., login credentials)
- Authorization: Granting access to specific resources based on permission

## The CIA Triad
Core security model that informs organizational risk assessment:
- Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data
  - Implemented through principle of least privilege
- Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable
  - Maintained through cryptography and encryption
- Availability: Data is accessible to those authorized to use it
  - Ensures systems function properly for timely access

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

**Six Core Functions:**
- Govern (New in CSF v2.0): Establishing and maintaining cybersecurity governance structures and processes
- Identify: Managing cybersecurity risk impact on organization's people and assets
- Protect: Implementing policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate threats
- Detect: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities
- Respond: Using proper procedures to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents
- Recover: Returning affected systems to normal operation

CSF v2.0 also emphasizes supply chain risk management.

## NIST SP 800-53
Unified framework for protecting federal government information systems, including systems provided by private companies for federal use.

## OWASP Security Principles
- Minimize attack surface area: Reduce potential vulnerabilities by disabling unnecessary features
