### Risk Levels
- **Low-risk assets**: Public information that wouldn't harm operations if compromised
- **Medium-risk assets**: Non-public information that could cause some damage if compromised
- **High-risk assets**: Information protected by regulations that would cause severe damage if compromised

### Risk Management Strategies
- **Acceptance**: Accepting a risk to maintain business continuity
- **Avoidance**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk entirely
- **Transference**: Transferring risk management to a third party
- **Mitigation**: Reducing the impact of a known risk

### Common Threats and Vulnerabilities
- **Social engineering**: Manipulation techniques exploiting human error (e.g., phishing)
- **Insider threats**: Staff members or vendors abusing authorized access
- **Advanced persistent threats (APTs)**: Maintaining unauthorized access for extended periods
- **Ransomware**: Malicious attacks encrypting organizational data for ransom payments
- **Technical vulnerabilities**: ProxyLogon, ZeroLogon, Log4Shell, etc.

### The Web Layers

- **Authentication**: Verifying who someone is (e.g., login credentials)
- **Authorization**: Granting access to specific resources based on permission

### The CIA Triad
Core security model that informs organizational risk assessment:

- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data
  - Implemented through principle of least privilege
- **Integrity**: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable
  - Maintained through cryptography and encryption
- **Availability**: Data is accessible to those authorized to use it
  - Ensures systems function properly for timely access

### NIST Frameworks

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

**Six Core Functions**:
1. **Govern** (New in CSF v2.0): Establishing and maintaining cybersecurity governance structures and processes
2. **Identify**: Managing cybersecurity risk impact on organization's people and assets
3. **Protect**: Implementing policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate threats
4. **Detect**: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities
5. **Respond**: Using proper procedures to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents
6. **Recover**: Returning affected systems to normal operation

CSF v2.0 also emphasizes supply chain risk management.

#### NIST SP 800-53
Unified framework for protecting federal government information systems, including systems provided by private companies for federal use.

#### NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
A seven-step approach to manage security and privacy risks:

1. **Prepare**: Establish risk management activities before breaches occur
2. **Categorize**: Develop processes based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs
3. **Select**: Choose and document controls that protect organizational assets
4. **Implement**: Execute security and privacy plans throughout the organization
5. **Assess**: Evaluate if controls are implemented correctly and meeting needs
6. **Authorize**: Take accountability for security and privacy risks
7. **Monitor**: Maintain awareness of system operations and effectiveness
