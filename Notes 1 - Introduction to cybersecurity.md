# Foundations of Cybersecurity

## Introduction to Cybersecurity

### Core Definition
Cybersecurity (security): The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation

### Key Cybersecurity Concepts
- **Threat actor**: Any person or group who presents a security risk
- **External threat**: Someone outside the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks, or devices
- **Internal threat**: Risk from current/former employees, external vendors, or trusted partners
  - Can be accidental (e.g., clicking a malicious link)
  - Can be intentional (unauthorized data access, system misuse)
- **Compliance**: Adhering to internal standards and external regulations to avoid fines and security breaches
- **Security frameworks**: Guidelines used to build plans that mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy
- **Security controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks
- **Security posture**: An organization's ability to manage defense of assets/data and react to change

### Types of Security
- **Network security**: Protecting an organization's network infrastructure from unauthorized access
- **Cloud security**: Ensuring assets stored in the cloud are properly configured and access is limited to authorized users

### The CIA Triad
Core security model that informs organizational risk assessment:

- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access specific assets/data
  - Implemented through principle of least privilege
- **Integrity**: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable
  - Maintained through cryptography and encryption
- **Availability**: Data is accessible to those authorized to use it
  - Ensures systems function properly for timely access

### Asset Management
- **Asset**: Item perceived as having value to an organization; value determined by associated cost
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Information used to infer an individual's identity
  - Examples: Full name, DOB, address, phone number, email, IP address
- **SPII (Sensitive PII)**: PII requiring stricter handling guidelines
  - Examples: SSN, medical/financial information, biometric data

## Importance of Cybersecurity

### Benefits to Organizations
- **Protection against threats**: Guards against both external and internal threats
- **Regulatory compliance**: Helps meet legal requirements and guidelines
- **Business productivity**: Maintains operations even during security incidents
- **Cost reduction**: Minimizes expenses associated with data loss and operational downtime
- **Brand trust**: Maintains customer confidence and protects reputation

### Protection of Personal Information
- **Identity theft**: Act of stealing personal information to commit fraud while impersonating a victim (primarily for financial gain)
