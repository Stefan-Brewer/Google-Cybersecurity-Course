## Professional statement 
My name is Stefan.  
I find the arms race between threat actors and security absolutely fascinating and want to do my part to protect people’s security in an ethical way.  
I am detail oriented and enjoy working with technology.  
I am good at picking up nuances and detecting when something does not fit.And if you give me a complex problem, I’ll love solving it.
