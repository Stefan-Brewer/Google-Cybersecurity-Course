# Consolidated Cybersecurity Study Notes

## Core Cybersecurity Concepts

### The Security Mindset
A security mindset involves continuously evaluating risks and identifying potential or actual breaches of systems, applications, or data. It requires understanding what assets need protection and from whom or what. This mindset helps in recognizing essential organizational assets and the threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that could affect them. Staying updated on the latest security threats and vulnerabilities is crucial. This proactive approach is vital for protecting all assets, from guest Wi-Fi networks to intellectual property and Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

### Asset and Data Classification
Protecting an organization's assets and data is crucial. Classification helps prioritize these protection efforts.

* **Data Classification Types**:
    * **Public Data**: Information accessible to the public, with minimal risk if exposed (e.g., press releases, job descriptions). Basic security measures are still necessary.
    * **Private Data**: Information not intended for public disclosure, where unauthorized access poses a serious risk (e.g., company email addresses, employee IDs, research data).
    * **Sensitive Data**: Information requiring robust protection from unauthorized access, as exposure can cause significant financial and reputational damage (e.g., PII, SPII, PHI like bank account numbers, passwords, Social Security numbers, medical information).
    * **Confidential Data**: Information crucial for ongoing business operations, often with restricted access and potentially requiring Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) (e.g., trade secrets, financial records, sensitive government data).

* **Asset Classification**:
    * Assets are labeled based on their sensitivity and importance.
    * **Low-Level Assets**: Include public data; their compromise results in minimal negative impact (e.g., company website address).
    * **High-Level Assets**: Encompass sensitive and confidential data; public leakage can severely impact competitive advantage, reputation, and customer trust (e.g., internal emails discussing trade secrets).
    * Organizations establish their own data classification policies that security professionals must understand.

### Incident Detection, Response, and Escalation
* **Events vs. Incidents**: A security event that results in a data breach is classified as a **security incident**. If an event is resolved without a breach, it is not considered an incident.
* **Importance of Reporting and Escalation**: All potential issues, regardless of their perceived significance, should be reported or escalated. For instance, an employee installing an unapproved application should be escalated due to potential vulnerabilities. Malicious code in logs represents a more significant issue requiring escalation. Escalation is the process of identifying a potential security incident, triaging it, and, if appropriate, handing it off to a more experienced team member. Not every incident requires escalation. Failure to escalate appropriately can lead to significant consequences.
* **Impact of Breaches**: Compromised data and assets can lead to financial losses, regulatory fines, and a loss of credibility. Protecting customer data (e.g., credit card numbers, PII) is a primary concern.
* **Escalation Policies**: Every company has unique escalation policies detailing who to notify, contact persons if primary responders are unavailable, and specific escalation methods (e.g., IT help desk, incident management tool, direct communication). Analysts must be familiar with these protocols.
* **Incident Criticality**: The urgency of a security incident depends heavily on the asset(s) it affects. Low-impact incidents (e.g., an employee with repeated failed login attempts due to a forgotten password) need addressing but are likely minimal in impact. High-impact incidents involve assets critical to business operations (e.g., a manufacturing plant's application, a database storing PII).
* **Analyst's Role in Escalation**: Entry-level analysts are crucial for escalating potential security events. They need attention to detail and the ability to follow escalation guidelines. Trusting instincts, asking questions, and understanding asset importance are key.

### Key Processes and Plans

* **Four-Part Security Process**:
    1.  Identify assets requiring protection.
    2.  Determine potential threats to those assets.
    3.  Implement tools and processes to detect potential threats.
    4.  Create Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plans.

* **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: A document outlining procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption.
    * **Essential Steps for BCPs**:
        1.  Conduct a business impact analysis (BIA).
        2.  Identify, document, and implement recovery steps for critical functions.
        3.  Organize a business continuity team (cybersecurity, IT, HR, communications, operations).
        4.  Conduct training for the BCP team.

* **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**: Outlines steps to minimize the impact of a security incident and resolve the threat.
    * **Steps should include**: Implementing recovery strategies for software and hardware, and identifying potentially impacted applications and data.

* **Information Lifecycle Strategy**:
    1.  Identify important assets.
    2.  Assess existing security measures and policies.
    3.  Protect identified assets by implementing security controls.
    4.  Monitor security processes continuously.

### Notification of Breaches
Many jurisdictions have breach notification laws requiring companies and government entities to inform individuals of security breaches involving PII (e.g., Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, medical records, addresses). Security analysts must stay informed about applicable, regularly updated security laws.

### Common Incident Types for Escalation

* **Malware Infection**: Malicious software (e.g., phishing, ransomware) infiltrates systems or networks.
* **Unauthorized Access**: An individual gains digital or physical access without permission (e.g., through brute force attacks).
* **Improper Usage**: An employee violates acceptable use policies, intentionally or unintentionally.

### Roles and Responsibilities in Escalation

* **Data Owners**: Accountable for data classification, protection, access, and use; decide who can access, edit, use, or destroy their specific information.
* **Data Controllers**: Determine the procedure and purpose for processing data, especially customer PII, ensuring compliance with regulations.
* **Data Processors**: Report to data controllers and process data on their behalf, often third-party vendors.
* **Data Custodians**: Assign and remove access to software or hardware, implement controls, grant/revoke access, create data policies, advise on threats, and monitor data.
* **Data Protection Officers (DPOs)**: Monitor internal compliance with data protection procedures, advise on obligations, and conduct assessments.

Entry-level analysts typically escalate to their direct supervisor but should understand these broader roles.

## Communicating Effectively with Stakeholders

### Understanding Stakeholders
A **stakeholder** is an individual or group with an interest in an organization's decisions or activities. Security threats affect the entire company, so stakeholder input is vital.

* **Key Stakeholders**:
    * **Risk Managers**: Identify risks, manage incident responses, notify legal and PR.
    * **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**: Overall responsibility for company operations and security.
    * **Chief Financial Officer (CFO)**: Manages financial operations, concerned with incident costs.
    * **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Develops security architecture, conducts risk analysis, and creates security/BCP plans.
    * **Operations Managers**: Oversee security professionals, often the first line of defense and responsible for daily security operations.

Entry-level analysts usually communicate with operations managers, who then report to senior stakeholders.

### Principles for Effective Communication

* **Clarity, Conciseness, Focus**: Avoid jargon and ensure a clear purpose.
* **Understand Stakeholder Needs**: Tailor information to what stakeholders require.
* **Relevance**: Share only the most pertinent information.
* **"Security Storytelling"**: Frame communications with a beginning (challenge), middle (impact), and end (solutions), supported by data.
* **Follow Protocols**: Adhere to organizational communication procedures.
* **Self-Reflection for Clarity**: Ask yourself: What do they need to know? Why is it important? When do they need to act? How can I explain it non-technically?

### Communication Methods

* **Instant Messaging/Phone Calls**: For straightforward messages or urgent responses.
* **Email/Documents**: For complex situations requiring detailed reports. Ensure correct recipients.
* **Visual Dashboards (Charts, Graphs, Infographics)**: Effective for conveying key details and metrics quickly.
